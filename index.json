We undertake a comprehensive analysis to characterize the evolution of SN 2020oi and constrain its progenitor system. We detect flux in excess of the fireball rise model δt≈2.5 days from the date of explosion in multi-band optical and UV photometry from the Las Cumbres Observatory and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, respectively. The derived SN bolometric luminosity is consistent with an explosion with Mej=0.81±0.03 M⊙, Ek=1.40±0.19×1051erg s−1, and MNi56=0.08±0.02 M⊙. Inspection of the event's decline reveals the highest Δm15,bol reported for a stripped-envelope event to date. Modeling of optical spectra near event peak indicates a partially mixed ejecta comparable in composition to the ejecta observed in SN 1994I, while the earliest spectrum shows signatures of a possible interaction with material of a distinct composition surrounding the SN progenitor. Further, Hubble Space Telescope (HST) pre-explosion imaging reveals a stellar cluster coincident with the event. From the cluster photometry, we derive the mass and age of the SN progenitor using stellar evolution models implemented in the BPASS library. Our results indicate that SN 2020oi occurred in a binary system from a progenitor of mass MZAMS≈9.5±1.0 M⊙, corresponding to an age of 27±7 Myr. SN 2020oi is the dimmest SN Ic event to date for which an early-time flux excess has been observed, and the first in which an early excess is unlikely to be associated with shock-cooling.","tags":null,"title":"An Early-Time Optical and Ultraviolet Excess in the type-Ic SN 2020oi","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"SN 2020oi is a type-Ic supernova, the core-collapse explosion of a young star missing hydrogen and helium in its outer envelope.

The explosion of a young and massive star will look different from the explosion of an old and compact one.

However, several observational domains, including SNe within days or hours of explosion and faint, red transients, are just beginning to be explored. Here, we present the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE), a novel optical time-domain survey on the Pan-STARRS telescopes. Our survey is designed to obtain well-sampled griz light curves for thousands of transient events up to z≈0.2. This large sample of transients with 4-band light curves will lay the foundation for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, providing a critical training set in similar filters and a well-calibrated low-redshift anchor of cosmologically useful SNe Ia to benefit dark energy science. As the name suggests, YSE complements and extends other ongoing time-domain surveys by discovering fast-rising SNe within a few hours to days of explosion. YSE is the only current four-band time-domain survey and is able to discover transients as faint ∼21.5 mag in gri and ∼20.5 mag in z, depths that allow us to probe the earliest epochs of stellar explosions. YSE is currently observing approximately 750 square degrees of sky every three days and we plan to increase the area to 1500 square degrees in the near future. When operating at full capacity, survey simulations show that YSE will find ∼5000 new SNe per year and at least two SNe within three days of explosion per month. To date, YSE has discovered or observed 8.3% of the transient candidates reported to the International Astronomical Union in 2020. We present an overview of YSE, including science goals, survey characteristics and a summary of our transient discoveries to date.","tags":null,"title":"The Young Supernova Experiment: Survey Goals, Overview, and Operations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1612504800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612504800,"objectID":"7e29b254d2a0dbf834f98a9e5395f62f","permalink":"https://alexandergagliano.github.io/talk/desc_alertbrokers/","publishdate":"2021-02-05T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/talk/desc_alertbrokers/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Building a DESC Transient Broker System: The Next Phase of PLAsTiCC","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1597122000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597122000,"objectID":"d18e92c389ec3422af31c385f3862fcd","permalink":"https://alexandergagliano.github.io/talk/rubin_pcw/","publishdate":"2020-08-11T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/rubin_pcw/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"GHOST: A Database of 16k Supernova Host Galaxies","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583431200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583431200,"objectID":"720e005ccf0307fc5fa13222a8886b62","permalink":"https://alexandergagliano.github.io/talk/ncsa_caps/","publishdate":"2020-03-05T12:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/talk/ncsa_caps/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"House of the Rising, Exploding Sun: Disentangling Correlations between Supernovae and their Hosts","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The chemical history of the inter-stellar medium (ISM) is notoriously difficult to simulate.

A total of 22,426 Globular cluster candidates were selected through a detailed morphological inspection and the analysis of their magnitude and colors in two wavebands, F475W (Sloan g) and F814W (I). The spatial distribution of globular clusters defines three main overdensities in Coma that can be associated with NGC 4889, NGC 4874, and IC 4051 but have spatial scales five to six times larger than individual galaxies.

I sat outside the library trying to find a connection when one of the students came up to me. I recognized him from my exoplanet talk. He told me he wanted to practice his English, so he spoke in English while I responded in French. We talked mainly about languages and his future. He said he wanted to go into robotics, but that there were no opportunities for him in Gabon.\nWhen I walked back home for lunch (guess what I had? FELIX’S SPAGHETTI), I found Sylla out front of his house working on a car. And by car, I mean more of a golf cart. We hung out for a bit and then I went off to take some more pictures. By my old house, I came upon a man out front trying to catch a feral tabby cat. I helped him for a bit but was wary of his motives, as he was pretty aggressive in trying to catch him/her. The cat ran off and fell into a storm drain, so I crawled in, with him watching on the other side, to get him/her out. I was nearly at the cat when the man at the other side of the drain snatched it. The cat started clawing at his hand and he flailed it around in response, trying to shake the cat off. I screamed at him in French to stop. The cat dove off, landing on solid ground, and then scurried into the bushes. So much for helping out.\nSylla and I took a stroll down the street leading up to the ecole. We got to the boutique with the Nigerian boys and Sylla instructed me to buy a pack of these British mint “bonbons”, which would help with my coughing. He says he had the same issue for about a week when he moved here because the humidity was so extreme. Back at home, he dropped 4 of the bonbons into some mint tea and let them dissolve. It worked like magic – by the end of the mug my sinuses were clear and my lungs were grateful.\nI ate dinner at Sylla’s place, savory crepes. I’m glad I’ve become so close with the professors here; the time would have passed by much more slowly without their company. He saw me drawing in my journal and decided to draw a picture of me, which is a masterpiece. To be added to the blog! The movie he put on didn’t work, so he invited over a student who brought with him a laptop full of downloaded movies. What resulted, instead of a film, was a several hour long conversation about African spirits and belief systems. I didn’t turn it into a formal interview, because I wasn’t getting too much about astronomy, but I hear stories of spirits of the forest and spirits of the sea. They told me of sirens and mermaids and spells that can bind your feet together or make you fall in love. They also said that those who have organized religion, regardless of the religion, are protected against spells. In exchange, they must make a vow to cast no spells unto others. I recorded the second half of the conversation on my phone. What was fascinating to me was how casually they discussed it, like there was nothing out of the ordinary about it at all. They just shrugged and said, “this stuff just happens in Africa.”\nI’ve been thinking more about why I am here, the research I am trying to do. I’m in a situation in which I have never been before: In a foreign country, alone, loose plans, with only my search for astronomy outreach and mythology to guide me. Without the rigidity of a formal program or Dr. Okouma’s instruction it is my motivation to which I cling, which propels me forward. When I meet people, I explain that I am a traveler on a journey, in search of something very specific. I feel like the child in The Alchemist during his time working in the China shop. I know that this time is temporary, and that I must be patient until I see the next clear direction to take, but at the moment I am restless and anxious to make progress.\n","date":1466985600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1466985600,"objectID":"61ada6c63def7104f46c58900964ceb7","permalink":"https://alexandergagliano.github.io/post/hortonfellowship19/","publishdate":"2016-06-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hortonfellowship19/","section":"post","summary":"Forest spirits and sirens of the sea.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Horton Fellowship Day 19: My First Glimpse of Mythology","type":"post"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":[],"content":"I don’t know if it was dust or humidity or what, but I could not sleep that entire miserable night. I woke up at all hours gasping and coughing. At 4am, my throat stinging, I went wandering before I realized I had finished the last of my bottled water. Luckily I rummaged through my groceries and drank some of the now room-temperature yogurt I had bought that now sat beside my bed. By the morning, I was sure I had pulmonary TB. Web MD is a dangerous game. I went back to my other house, where there was still no power, and laid in the heat wheezing on the couch for a good part of the morning. At about noon, I finally decided to leave the house. I set off with my camera and took a few pictures around the campus. While I was sneaking about in the forest behind my house I heard a man shouting to me “galio, galio, galio!” This was definitely not a word in French, and I assumed he was trying to tell me that I wasn’t allowed to be back there so I pretended not to hear him.\nBut he was insistent. He walked up to the fence behind me and continued to call out, “galio, galio, galio!” Finally I turned around and walked back to him. He was a young man, maybe late 20’s, wearing basketball shorts and a sleeveless shirt. Between his fingertips, he cradled a weathered basketball. He smiled and asked me if I wanted to play with him. And I did!\nI am absolutely terrible at basketball, but thankfully so was he. We played horse; neither of us made a single shot. His name was Prime. It was from him that I learned that Gabon has no laws regarding downloading of pirated movies, tv shows, music, etc. IIIIIIIIIIIInteresting. I also learned that a little kid he asked said my name was “Galio” instead of “Gagliano” so that was what he called me.\nA bit later, I left to pop into Mr. Chekoubi’s office to explain the struggle of a night I had. We went for a walk so that he could show me around, and we stopped at a few boutiques along the way. The little shop nearest the campus are run by two really nice Nigerian teenagers who give you a free drink every time you buy something! I picked up some manioc wrapped in a banana leaf, which was WEIRD, and Chekoubi bought some food for his post-sunset feast (he was Muslim, and it’s the middle of Ramadan). Finally, I gave Mr. Seck a call and he told me I could move into my new place. Of the new house:\nPros:  They filled the fridge with water bottles (and beer?) They gave me plates and forks and silverware and a microwave Closer to Sylla/Chekoubi/the university I’m not paying for housing which is insane  Cons:  The mattress is quite painful No A/C in the main room-no wifi like the old place Haven\u0026rsquo;t figured out how to wash my clothes yet  Seck moved me in and then used this gadget he kept in his pocket to punch me out a local sim card to fit in my Galaxy. Turns out that the power didn’t “go out” at all in my old place, they just stopped paying for it because they hadn’t expected me to still be living there. Lovely. We went deep into town to see a man at a shop about giving me more electricity (the world is strange) and then I settled in for the night. Chekoubi and I went over to Sylla’s house, the goofy Nigerian professor, and he made us crepes while we watched the French version of the new Star Wars movie.\n","date":1466899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1466899200,"objectID":"fe6c6eeb890737fbf1f75fbddff11384","permalink":"https://alexandergagliano.github.io/post/hortonfellowship18/","publishdate":"2016-06-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hortonfellowship18/","section":"post","summary":"Another day with Chekoubi, Seck, and Sylla!","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Horton Fellowship Day 18: Manioc Madness","type":"post"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":[],"content":"I’m learning a great deal about the culture and mythology here from conversations with the maid’s children - or at least, they want me to think I am. A young girl came in one morning to sweep and ended up sitting on the couch talking to me about the wildest things. She said that it was a dangerous secret but that all the important people in Gabon (even the president) go to this club called “La Loge”. They dance and drink, but also do some sort of voodoo witchcraft business. They wear rings with symbols of human eyes on them and try to control their enemies, or something like that. She also discussed her faith, and from my interactions so far it seems that the majority of Gabonese people are highly religious.\nDr. Okouma explained to me that I would be moving to another house for the rest of the summer. There would be no more maid or chef service, and I would have to pay for my electricity from here on out. I didn’t mind, I was still just thrilled to not be paying for the housing. As it turns out, I didn’t move out at all that day. I left to go get ahold of some telescopes that were rumored to be somewhere around the campus, and Mr. Seck explored the classrooms with me. In the very last room we tore apart (of course), we came upon them: 200 Galileoscopes unopened in the corner!\nI was amazed to see so many telescopes available but unused. Was the cloud coverage every night really too bad to ever take one out, or were there just not enough teachers interested in leading a lesson with them?\nMr. Seck gave me 2 to assemble and then took me to the grocery store. Or so I thought. Turns out Seck knows every single person in Libreville, because we stopped at a pizzeria on the way so that he could chat up the owners. He talked to pretty much everybody in the grocery store, and then we stopped at a street vendor on the way home where he bought me the spiciest sausage I have ever eaten in my life. After that was an Airtel vendor where he added credit onto his cell phone, and then back to the pizzeria for more conversation. And also a bit of pizza.\nHe dropped me off at my place by nightfall, where there had been no power all day. A woman came by and told me that I could sleep in another house just for the night, so I scrambled to bring my bag and dinner over.

I met with a professor the other day, a Moroccan man named Mr. Chekoubi, who gave me a quick tour of the new polytechnic institute. The facilities are small but quite good. After the tour, Chekoubi sat me down in his office and asked me my plan. I had thought that I was going to be working with high school teachers, but none of them had gotten back to me, so I had no idea what to say. Trying to think on my feet, I told him:\n“Well, I’d like to talk to the university students about some basics of astronomy and maybe do a single activity, and then hopefully get a smaller focus group together of a few really motivated kids that I could train in the astronomy activities I had planned so that we have a team to collaborate with Nommo on the outreach for the high school and the general public.”\nAnd then he agreed to pull together 10 of his best students to help me! Just like that!\nMr. Chekoubi booked the main lecture room for Mercredi from 1400-1600. So now I was tasked with choosing any topic in astronomy, creating a presentation for it in French, and finding an age-appropriate activity to go along with it. Oh, and it had to be two hours long.\nI decided to talk about exoplanet detection, because I found a pretty cool interactive lab online that the students could work through. I didn’t end up using the interactive lab because the internet wasn’t strong enough, but I found another outreach activity deriving Kepler’s third laws from the orbits of the moons of Jupiter and decided to use that instead. It took me forever to translate the worksheets to French, but once I did I met with Chekoubi and he corrected a few French errors in my presentation. Always have trouble with those masculine/feminine words!\nMercredi came and by 1400 only a single student had showed up. Great. I looked to Mr. Chekoubi expectantly, and he told me to wait a few minutes. Time passes more slowly in Africa, remember? By 1430, 25-30 students had arrived, and decided to start. And guess what? I DID IT. No doubt I got derailed at a few points, and I misused a few words, but in general I’m quite happy with how it went. I was able to freely articulate my ideas in French instead of just following a memorized script, and I really felt in the zone. The students were answering my questions and they seemed engaged throughout the entire thing! I was on top of the world. The real curveball came when we had no aux cable and so I couldn\u0026rsquo;t play the videos I had prepared. Instead, I had to explain the basic premise of gravitational microlensing myself. Talk about circumlocution.\nAfter the lecture, I asked for anyone that was interested in helping me with my research could write their emails on a piece of paper. I got 21 emails! There were maybe 40 people there by the end of the talk. There was one student who even asked if I had ever lived in France because I spoke French so well! All in all, an exciting first lecture.\nALSO gravitational waves were detected for the second time! I won’t get into it for brevity’s sake, but that’s amazing.\n","date":1466640000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1466640000,"objectID":"23db8d78f05c18c72f55e5aeeec0c6cc","permalink":"https://alexandergagliano.github.io/post/hortonfellowship1415/","publishdate":"2016-06-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hortonfellowship1415/","section":"post","summary":"My first attempt at an introductory exoplanet lecture...in French!","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Horton Fellowship Days 14, 15: Libreville, Gabon","type":"post"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":[],"content":"It is said that time moves more slowly in Africa, and it is correct. I’ve spent the past few days reading and memorizing constellations (take the arc to Arcturis and the spike to Spica), but things have yet to pick up with the outreach. Dr. Okouma, my main collaborator, is in South Africa on other business, so I have been keeping myself busy with background reading and exploring with my camera. I found online a comprehensive study of Fang mythology, the people to the north of Gabon. I read one of the myths to Felix, who was Fang, while he was cooking dinner. He loved it! He laughed and got excited and finished my sentences. It was so rewarding to see him connect to the mythology like that. It also represented a monumental victory for me because the myth was written in English, and I translated it into French in real time while I read it to Felix.\nDay 11 marked the end of exams for the Lycée! There was an end of the year ceremony by the track to commemorate the hard work of the students. They started by singing the national anthem of Gabon, and then the school anthem. A few uniformed students acted out skits about going to school while the rest laughed. Later on, two students in fedoras did a dance to a series of Michael Jackson songs! I only wish high school graduations in the United States were that cool.\nWhen the time came to recognize the students, each one was called up, their name read, and their final marks in each class announced (THAT I’m glad they don’t do in the US). Then the Minister of Education (or something like that) would kiss them on each cheek and give them a gift particular to each child’s main focus. If a student wants to go into sports education, they gave him a soccer ball or a basketball. A kid who wanted to go into art got a canvas. I assume that’s what they were, anyway; the gifts were wrapped up. What a marvelous idea! I’m jealous. Many adults there donned the same shirt with a young man’s face on it. Felix later told me that it was Mme Le President’s son, who had passed away recently.\nFor the rest of the day I’ll just be sending emails and calling people from the astro society here to set something up. ALSO I don’t have any shampoo or conditioner so out of desperation this morning I just scrubbed my hair with a bar of soap and you know what? It actually worked like a charm! My hair feels great!

With the last few minutes on the plane, I finally got my first view of Gabon. It truly looked like a country that had sprung up from the middle of the rainforest. For every house, there were two palm trees. The houses seemed simple and inexpensive, but their florescent facades only contributed to the overall beauty. The landscape reminded me of forests of Vietnam as portrayed in any of the many Vietnam War movies.\nThe second I turned the corner into our gate, I saw three people holding a sign with my name on it. One, a woman in maybe her 30’s, disappeared with the sign the second I identified myself. The other two, a man in a suit and a beautiful young woman in holding an impressive leather folder, helped me from there. They took care of my bag, my visa, and customs, telling everybody that I was “L’astronaute des Etats-Unis”.\nThe woman called for transportation and sent me off in a van. After several stops along the way and me falling asleep for most of them, we came upon the Lycée Berthe et Jean d’Essassa. A woman was at the door to see me in. She was impressed with my French and showed me inside. The place I was staying was a small house, with two bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom, and a living room. The woman introduced me to my maid, and said that my food would be coming later. I was amazed at the level of accommodation! I had assumed I’d be in something like a dorm, figuring things out for myself.\nA man named Felix knocked at the door soon after and brought in some food. Turns out Felix is my chef – I nervously asked if the meals were just for today, and he laughed and told me he’d make me breakfast, lunch, and dinner for as long as I was staying there. I couldn’t believe it. I kept thanking him, but deep down I felt guiltier and guiltier with each new luxury. I had done nothing here yet, was just some twenty-something student passing through and already I was living better than nearly everyone we had driven past on the way there. The pervasive feeling of reward without work, about which Gandhi in his Satyagraha had warned, overcame me, and for the rest of the day I asked Felix if I could help clean or do dishes or anything at all to help earn my keep. He shook his head each time, saying “You have your work and I have mine.”\nI spent the rest of the day planning astronomy activities.

I decided I wanted to bungee jump from the Orlando towers in Soweto with my few hours left, but unfortunately they didn’t offer jumps on Mondays. Steven and I went to the towers anyway and they let me head to the top for R70 (maybe $5?). I got into a shaky metal cage with a man in a suit, and he threw a lever. The cage slowly climbed higher and higher, rattling the entire way up. The scariest part wasn’t the height, it was the fact that the track was inclined. The cage was tilted toward the tower so you felt like you were going to slide out the entire time. At the top, though, the view of Soweto was absolutely incredible. You really got a feel for the township as a whole, from the matchbox houses to the massive hospital. Every time the wind blew, the bridge connecting the towers swayed.\nSteven took me to Constitution Hill with my last 2 hours, a prison where Mandela and Gandhi were both held after their resistance. They let us go into the solitary confinement cells and, on the backs of the doors, prisoners had scratched messages of all kinds: “Let me die”, “Black power”, “[so and so] was here”. No replicas, no reenactments, real etchings made by real prisoners who stood where I stood. I shivered.\nI checked in for my flight after a quick goodbye to Steven and began my trip to Ethiopia. On the way, a kid working for the Airline handed me a voucher for a free night at an Ethiopian hotel! AND they were paying for my dinner and breakfast the next morning! Airlines do that?? In Addis Ababa, I sat at the counter waiting for the shuttle when the man behind the counter started talking to me. The conversation, in a nutshell:\nHim: “I don’t think Donald Trump would make a good president for the United States.” [I’m nodding] “I mean, I ALSO hate all the Muslims, but that’s just not the way to go about doing it.” [I stop nodding]\nThe shuttle arrives and two other men and I shuffle in. I get to talking to one of them, and explain to him the astronomy work I’m trying to do in Gabon and why I think it’s important. He replies, “My brother, I think you are right. We all learned about the stars when we were kids but then we never got to go to them.” (I’m paraphrasing, but only a little) I thought that phrasing was beautiful. People are quickly taught that astronomy is a theoretical discipline with little application, especially in developing countries where short term demands usually beat out long term goals. His words gave me new confidence to follow through with my work in Gabon to the best of my ability.\nAt the hotel, I ate a buffet-style dinner with the two men from the shuttle. We talked about pretty much everything they could think of: politics, religion, cultural differences. We split a bottle of red wine as they explained their belief systems and I explained mine.

We took a brief tour of Gandhi’s living quarters, where he mainly spun fabric and read. Large metal slabs with his handwritten quotes engraved in them were situated around the grounds. It was calm and peaceful and beautiful, and with more time I’d love to have actually stayed there (they turned it into a B\u0026amp;B). As an homage to his life, they offer introductory yoga and meditation classes, as well as tea breaks in the garden. Apparently it’s not a common tourist attraction at all, so I was glad to have chosen it.\nNext, Paul and I went into Newtown. He stayed with me the entire time instead of just dropping me off, and together we grabbed a meal in the food court of the mall nearby. Mielepap and steak, of course! We toured Museum Africa, an enormous collection of the most eclectic exhibits. At the ground floor we walked through an exhibition of photography by a South African staying in Denmark. The beautiful photos were mainly of strangers, and I resolved to ask more strangers to take their picture. Past that was a hall dedicated to Apartheid artifacts, and then one on traditional African medicine. Next, we walked through a hall whose walls traced the development of the digital camera and also the movie making industry. We finished at a geology exhibit, and then headed back to the hotel.\nPaul dropped me off at the complex near my hotel so I wouldn’t be scrambling for a place to eat at the last minute again. He dropped me in the middle of a set of shops, but something seemed off. It was just before 5pm, and every place was closed. The grocery store, the restaurants, the pharmacy, everything. And I don’t just mean they had shut down for the day. The entire place was utterly devoid of life, and most of the places were padlocked and wrapped in chains.\nI wandered for a bit, confused. Finally, a man popped out from behind a building and started toward me in the parking lot. I jogged over to talk to him, but when we reached each other he only looked at me in silence through cloudy, lifeless eyes. Dead silence. He held up a sign to me that certified that he was deaf and blind, and asking me for some change. I gave him a bit and he wandered off smiling. I started to wonder how he had known I was there when my hunger brought me back to the present.\nWalking onward, I finally came upon a sports bar by the name of “Mama Rockets” – or something like that. I walked inside to find it full of people, sound, and life, like I had imagined the last post-apocalyptic 20 minutes. I ordered a massive burger and a carafe of wine and was soon hit with the deeply uncomfortable realization that everyone eating at the restaurant was white, and everyone working at the restaurant was black. The de facto segregation of Johannesburg was still prevalent in most places I had gone, to varying degrees.\nAfter I paid the bill, I hopped across the highway back to my hotel. Strange day!\n","date":1465776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1465776000,"objectID":"7f5a2a94a1bbc2536f7eb37ff2214dfe","permalink":"https://alexandergagliano.github.io/post/hortonfellowship5/","publishdate":"2016-06-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hortonfellowship5/","section":"post","summary":"My last full day in Joburg, at the Satyagraha house in Newtown.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Horton Fellowship Day 5: Ive Gandhi Way of The Tourist","type":"post"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":[],"content":"I had been waiting for the hotel shuttle to take me to my next hotel for maybe 5 minutes when a tour guide appeared and asked me where I was going. He was persistant, but I was not determined to get suckered into paying too much. He won. As it turned out, the shuttle I was trying to take was going to the wrong Holiday Inn. So now here Steven and I are, sitting in traffic, talking about our lives (He actually gave me the best price out of anyone I could find, R400).\nAt the next hotel, I checked in and tried to respond to an email from Dr. Okouma. The internet was out. He\u0026rsquo;d been trying to contact me to set up a skype session with some other members of Nommo Astronomia, the astronomical society in Gabon, but I had been traveling around too often to make it happen. Back at the concierge desk I asked if they knew of any fun things in the immediate area, desperate to shake Steven who was currently was sitting in the lobby. He was a great guy to talk to, but I was worried he was going to rip me off. The woman behind the counter thinks for a minute, then shrugs and says, \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t think of a single thing. Sorry.\u0026rdquo; Isn\u0026rsquo;t that the whole point of a concierge desk? You\u0026rsquo;ve let me down, lady.\nSteven continued discussing his history in the car together. His father died after getting swept up in the anti-apartheid movement when he was young, and his mom sold homemade cheap beer to try and get him and his siblings through school. A liter of the stuff would go for 10 cents; the money only got him to 7th grade. After that, he dropped out to join the police force. He\u0026rsquo;s since worked a bit for a hotel and then became a tour guide. I asked him if he ever thought about going back to school and he says he has, but he never will. He\u0026rsquo;s in his fifties now with kids of his own, and he\u0026rsquo;d rather make money to get them through school so that they\u0026rsquo;ll never have to make the same decisions he did. I quickly softened towards him. Of course everyone trying to make money off of tourists has their own backstories for it, but it was still sad to hear it firsthand.\nThe apartheid museum was massive. Based on your entrance ticket, you were randomly assigned a color: \u0026ldquo;white\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;nonwhite\u0026rdquo;. This determined your path through the museum, obviously emulating Apartheid segregation. I fell asleep during a good majority of the intro movie - damn jetlag - but I remember them talking about how legislation in Apartheid South Africa changed all the time classifying people as \u0026ldquo;white\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;nonwhite\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;colored\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;native\u0026rdquo;. They called it the \u0026ldquo;Chameleon Dance\u0026rdquo; because people would change \u0026ldquo;colors\u0026rdquo; all the time, at least in the eyes of the laws. The stories of prisoners were unsurprisingly tragic; it\u0026rsquo;s insane to think that this all happened so recently.\nAfter lunch I visited Gold Reef Park across the street, an abandoned gold mine turned amusement park. It was R200 to get into the mine tour, which only lasted around 20 minutes. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t much to it, but the gold pouring demonstration afterwards was surprisingly enjoyable!\nWhen I got back to the hotel, though, the struggle to find dinner began. Turns out the hotel restaurant was closed by the time I got there (5pm?) and no restaurant was within walking distance. Steven had already left, so the hotel gave me a list of restaurants from which I could order delivery. I called from my room - or at least, tried, only to find that my phone was broken. So I went to order online instead - and then remembered that the internet was out. Turns out the wifi worked in the hallways, so I sat on my phone outside my room ordering the food. 30 minutes later I followed up with concierge, and they said no order was placed! So I used their phone to call and place another order, and then waited in the lobby until it came. For some reason they had put me down as \u0026ldquo;Omar\u0026rdquo;, and when they got to the hotel they tried to give the food to someone else!\nHungry and tired, I ran upstairs with the meal. There was nothing but soda on the menu, so I figured I could try out my water filter in the sink of my room. I filled up the sink, plopped in the hose, started pumping, and water shot out directly onto my face and shirt. Turns out some assembly is required. I filled my Nalgene and went to eat dinner while the iodine tablets dissolved. I had ordered a \u0026ldquo;bunny chow\u0026rdquo;, a thick stew served in a bread bowl that Henry had heard about. Mine didn\u0026rsquo;t have any bunny in it; I couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell you why they call it that. They gave me no silverware, so I scooped it out with the tin foil in which it came. In a damp shirt. Not my finest moment. I popped back out into the hallway just long enough to ask my dad to book my next night at another hotel, and then went to sleep.\n","date":1465689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1465689600,"objectID":"3f4629b1809cb20a4d7b2791f6a4661c","permalink":"https://alexandergagliano.github.io/post/hortonfellowship4/","publishdate":"2016-06-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hortonfellowship4/","section":"post","summary":"Exploring the history of SA through the Apartheid Museum .","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Horton Fellowship Day 4: Johannesburg","type":"post"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":[],"content":"From exploring the hotel a bit the day before, I found a bowl in the gym they keep stocked with fresh fuit. I went in this morning and grabbed a pear on my way out to meet Henry. He was half an hour early, so we had time before picking up our Singaporean travelers to stop by another one of Nelson Mandela\u0026rsquo;s houses. The house in Soweto was small, from his youth; this one was far nicer. Out front, there was a small pile of stones upon which people had left messages of love and support from all over the world. Henry brought with him a marker and a blank stone, and I left a note of my own - a small mark of my time in Johannesburg.\nWe slowed to a stop in the midst of a major traffic jam on the main road into Pilanesburg. After about 45 minutes, the cause of the jam was made clear: protesting transportation workers. By the time we had gotten through, there were charred tires and stones where they had blocked off the road in demonstration, and along the shoulder we saw two trucks burnt down to their frames. I found out later that they transported goods to and from the mines upon which Johannesburg was built, and they were forced to work in deplorable conditions. They staged a protest back in 2012 where they sat by the mines and refused to work. In response, the government came out and shot them all.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marikana_killings#The_16_August_massacre\nAccording to the wikipedia page, 47 people were killed in total. Henry says it\u0026rsquo;s not a secret that the government acted criminally. Henry has spoken quite a bit about South African politics as well, and not in the most positive of lights. At the moment, Jacob Zuma is president. He\u0026rsquo;s a member of the ANC party, as Nelson Mandela was, but according to Henry Zuma\u0026rsquo;s a criminal. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting that in South Africa people align much more closely with a candidate than with a party. They loved Mandela, and most don\u0026rsquo;t like Zuma. Zuma apparently stole loads of money from the country of South Africa and built himself a mansion with a pool. When asked where the money came from, Zuma said he took out a loan.\nUnafraid of Zuma, some badass woman (I will refer to her from here on out as Judy Justice) had him investigated and found no record of him taking out any loan. She stood up in the middle of parliament, in front of everyone, and said to him: \u0026ldquo;Mr. President, you are a liar and a thief and I can prove it!\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s awesome. In response, he changed his story and said that actually his sons gave him the money. Mrs. Justice actually goes and talks to the sons, who say they have no idea what he\u0026rsquo;s talking about. Zuma says, \u0026ldquo;Okay, well the pool was paid for with state appropriated funds, but it\u0026rsquo;s a necessary expense because I conduct important govt. business in that house and if it catches fire the water from the pool will be used to put it out.\u0026rdquo; Insane! Mrs. Justice, fed up at this point, drives to his house to investigate further to find that he\u0026rsquo;s put out fire hoses alongside the pool for draining.\nZuma has been tried by the highest court in SA and found unanimously guilty of stealing money, but parliament is a majority members of his own party so they won\u0026rsquo;t impeach him. Another thing worth mentioning: He underwent trial in 2005 after being accused of raping a woman he knew. He claimed it was consensual. The accuser was a well known HIV-positive AIDS activist, and Zuma (who was then head of the national AIDS council) admitted to not wearing a condom even though he knew she was HIV positive. That was okay because, according to him, he showered afterwards. HIV rates shot up in SA in the years after as his followers took showering to be a legitimate form of HIV prevention. There are more than a few outrageous things that happen around the world that we dont hear about in the US, as I\u0026rsquo;m learning.\nThe group of Singaporean travelers were Benny, the father; Phoebe, the daughter; and Eileen, the mother. They were a goofy group and I was thrilled to get to travel with them for the day! On the road to the reserve, Benny asked Henry about the business structure of running a tourism agency. Benny talked a lot about different business structures. I never asked him what he did for a living, but I could\u0026rsquo;ve ventured a guess.\nWe finally arrived at the reserve and started on an enormous lunch. It had fruit, vegetables, LOTS of game meat, and pretty much everything else you can imagine. I was starving by the time I got there (the single pear didn\u0026rsquo;t sate me, as it turned out), and I ate much too much, much too quickly. As we were about to leave a pair of little birds, their fluorescent feathers shimmering in the hot African sun, flew down and landed on Henry\u0026rsquo;s plate.\nAfter lunch, Henry sent us off with another tour guide and the trek began. We saw lions, wildebeests (they really do look exactly like in the Wild Thornberrys and I\u0026rsquo;m sorry for the reference), impala, rhinos, warthogs (according to Benny they knew about my steak the night before), elephants, and zebra. The second half of the trek, I saw some beautiful giraffe setting out toward the watering hole. The entire scene was as surreal as anything I had ever seen. Looking out over the seemingly endless landscape, ever alive with rustling wildlife, a happiness washed over me. A brief thought fluttered through my mind that maybe sitting at a computer reducing astronomy data wasn\u0026rsquo;t how I wanted to spend my days. After all, as Henry says, \u0026ldquo;you go back to your soul when you\u0026rsquo;re in the bush.\u0026rdquo;\nNight fell soon after, and I was huddling under a blanket against the wind by the time we made it back into camp. We all slept the entire car ride back. I booked a night at the Holiday Inn Express Sandton for the next night with most of my remaining points; it definitely won\u0026rsquo;t be as luxurious as here, but at least I don\u0026rsquo;t have to pay for it!\n","date":1465603200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560211200,"objectID":"68c475dff88064891fcd62bf46ac6742","permalink":"https://alexandergagliano.github.io/post/hortonfellowship3/","publishdate":"2016-06-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hortonfellowship3/","section":"post","summary":"Exploring the politics and game animals of South Africa.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Horton Fellowship Day 3: Far Out Safari, Pilanesburg","type":"post"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":[],"content":"Day 2! Landing at OR Tambo in Johannesburg, I paid a courier to show me to my hotel (turns out it was across the street) and collapsed onto my bed. The concierge told me about a cultural tour to Soweto, a poor township where Nelson Mandela had lived for a time, and I decided to take it.\nHenry, my tour guide, was there to pick me up an hour later. He was a man unlike any I\u0026rsquo;d ever met, and one whom I imagine to be the archetypal white South African. His accent was close to that of an Englishman, but his booming voice and jovial disposition reminded me for some reason of an Irishman. He told me he used to play rugby when he was in school. It was fascinating to listen to him talk - he rolled his tongue when teaching me words in Afrikaans, and he would say \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s the way!\u0026rdquo; whenever he could. Did you have a good meal? There\u0026rsquo;s the way! Manage to spot a jaguar on the trek? There\u0026rsquo;s the way! As I\u0026rsquo;ve found to be true of all friendly people from South Africa, he called all women he encountered \u0026ldquo;mama\u0026rdquo; and all men \u0026ldquo;baba\u0026rdquo;. On the ~45 minute drive to Soweto, he spoke of his time in the brass band during his 2 year military service, and then of his time as a paramedic/search and rescue volunteer. Because rioting and violence was common back then, him and his men painted a bulletproof military truck white to serve as their ambulance. This presented a unique problem: If someone were to shoot into the truck during a rescue, the bullet would bounce around the interior of the truck and wreak havoc. To get around this, they made the floor of the ambulance removable. During a rescue, they would drive over the victim, pull out the floor and, \u0026ldquo;if he wasn\u0026rsquo;t too big, we hauled him right up!\u0026rdquo; He didn\u0026rsquo;t offer their backup plan if a victim was too big. Yikes. We made a quick stop at a local restaurant that served traditional food. Being so close to so many animals, South Africans LIVE for their meats. I had lamb, beef, and chicken, along with a thick maize porridge called mielepap that had no real taste to it. Mielepap is everywhere in South Africa.\nFrom there, it was a short walk to Nelson Mandela\u0026rsquo;s former house. Mandela is hugely respected in South Africa, and often referred as \u0026ldquo;Tata Madiba\u0026rdquo; (father Madiba, his clan name). He was educated as a lawyer, and many say there won\u0026rsquo;t be another president as well-educated for a very long time. In contrast, the current president Zuma, so I\u0026rsquo;m told, gets confused when discussing the economic status of the country. More on him later. Scorch marks stained the ceiling and bullet holes littered the walls of this little brick house, souvenirs of a much more divided country than today. It\u0026rsquo;s incredible that a man symbolizing peace and love could have been so despised by anyone. Of course, there were many who wanted to maintain the Apartheid power hierarchy that he set out to dismantle.\nAfter Mandela\u0026rsquo;s house, we explored a museum on the history of Soweto, the epicenter of much of the student protests against Apartheid. In particular, students demanded that they be taught in their native language of Zulu instead of the Dutch-imposed Afrikaans. Afrikaans, if you\u0026rsquo;ve never heard it, is this fascinating hybrid of Dutch, French, and a few other romance languages. When Henry spoke it, it sounded like words from these languages had been haphazardly cut and pasted together to form the new language - the ransom note of imperialist powers. It was forbidden to take any pictures in the museum because, according to Henry, \u0026ldquo;The Dutch think it makes them look bad.\u0026rdquo; How absurd that this type of censorship is allowed! And what a cruel irony that, despite the abolition of Apartheid and the growth of an independent South Africa, it\u0026rsquo;s still the white man that gets to control the narrative.\nI was halfway through the museum when a massive group of young schoolchildren in matching green outfits swarmed the halls. We crossed paths as I was about to take the stairs back down to the bottom floor. A young girl at the head of the group looked at the stairs and then at me and asked, \u0026ldquo;Can we go down?\u0026rdquo; I shrugged. The whole group burst out laughing and charged down the steps.\nAfter the tour, which cost me about 1200 Rand, Henry drove me back to the hotel and I headed back out for dinner. Henry had mentioned \u0026ldquo;Emperor\u0026rsquo;s Palace\u0026rdquo; as a good place to eat, so I took the shuttle there and popped into the first restaurant I found. I was halfway through a warthog steak and mielepap (treating myself), when two middle-aged women waved me over to sit with them. I did, and we exchanged introductions. We talked for a bit, but soon it became clear how drunk they were. Things went from bad to worse when one of them started getting handsy, and by the time they were debating which of them was going to go home with me I politely excused myself.\nDelicious steak, though!\nBack at the hotel, I booked another night\u0026rsquo;s stay with the points on my IHG account. Last Christmas I was not having it with my Dad making me fill out notecards for a points promotion, but as much much as I hate to admit it the hot shower and the cozy mattress now had me beyond grateful. Tomorrow, Henry is going to lead me and a Singaporean family on a trek through Pilanesburg reserve!\n","date":1465516800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1462838400,"objectID":"2c580b6f26912e67b2affbac8e1ed76f","permalink":"https://alexandergagliano.github.io/post/hortonfellowship2/","publishdate":"2016-06-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hortonfellowship2/","section":"post","summary":"My first day in Johannesburg, South Africa!","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Horton Fellowship Day 2: Soweto, Cultural Center","type":"post"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":[],"content":"They say there comes a time, after all of the planning has been done, the preparations set in place, and the logistics firmly established, that you can sit back and watch your plan elegantly unfold. They are wrong. The morning of May 30th had arrived, and my passport had vanished into thin air. My flight out of the country to begin my pilgrimage to Gabon was the evening of May 31st. This, as you could probably imagine, was a very bad thing. Over a year of planning for various hypotheticals, and my entire trip still winds up hanging by a thread 24 hours from takeoff.\nMurmurs through various online forums spoke of an expedited passport service for my exact situation. I called up the main office in DC, only to find that their first availability was on June 8th. No luck. In a last minute act of desperation, my dad told me to show up at the passport office as early as possible the next morning, without an appointment, and beg to have a new one made. So 330am, May 31st, my alarm goes off and I\u0026rsquo;m out the door. I arrived at 5am, 3 hours before the office actually opened. To my amazement, a line had already begun to form outside the building! 8 hours of waiting and $200 later I left with a new passport in hand. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe it. Quite a handy resource to know about! I would have been more ecstatic at the time had I been smart enough to shove some granola bars into my pocket that morning, but I felt nothing but exhaustion. It\u0026rsquo;s amazing how a few pages can make or break even the best laid plans - or, alternatively, my plans.\nFour hours later, I was on my overnight to Paris. I had just 14 hours to get in as many of the sights as I could, and I used every last one of them. From the Eiffel tower, to the Arc de Triomphe, to sneaking down side streets and popping into patisseries, my time in Paris was a whirlwind of culture. Most of my time was spent wandering and just seeing what I found, which led me to the beautiful Jardin des Tuileries. I sat down with a crepe and watched people pass by for a bit, needing a break from running around. It was there that it finally dawned on me that the next three and a half months I would spend traveling alone. It was a weird feeling. Life for me has always been about shared experience, and I wondered how different of a trip this one would be without someone at my side every step of the way.\nWith the crepe finished, I walked on in search of something new. Less than 5 minutes had gone by before I realized I had left my NASA drawstring bag back in the park. I ran back to find four police officers walking around the area and talking into walkie talkies, and a fifth one beginning to rope of the area with police tape. There, in the middle of the group, sat my bag. Stuffed with packs of polaroid film, the bag was stretched to accommodate what seemed to be a solid cube inside it. It looked to them like a bomb. I quickly explained (in French) my mistake to the police and they reluctantly let me retrieve the bag. I felt guilty for worrying them; no doubt they were nervous after the recent bombings.\nAfter a quick museum tour, I met up with Gersande, Gabi\u0026rsquo;s friend from Peru, and her friend at a bar for a quick drink. It was the perfect way to decompress after a perfect day. I stayed for longer than I should have, appreciating the conversation, before jumping on the metro back to the airport. Paris was surreal, and hours after leaving it was hard to believe I had been there. Tomorrow morning, I arrive in Johannesburg for a 4 day layover. I\u0026rsquo;m still not sure what I\u0026rsquo;ll be doing there, nor have I found a place to stay for 3 out of the 4 nights. Okay, so maybe I didn\u0026rsquo;t do so much planning for the layovers.

As a result, the culture across the country is beautifully diverse.\nOne of the prominent traditional religions in Gabon is called Bwiti. It is practiced by many different ethnic groups, but its largest congregation is the Fang people to the north. During a ceremony I was able to witness, Fang initiates were adorned with images of the sun, the moon, and the stars. The leader of the ceremony also wore a shirt with these images. These objects represent the invisible world of spirits, and the knowledge gained from initiation.\nThe Tsogo people in central Gabon use astronomy predominantly in names. It is said that Tsogo people who lead a moral life will become a star after death, so children are named after objects in the sky, such as Ngonde, the moon and Mononga, the star, to give them good luck in life. In such close proximity to the Congolese rainforest, Tsogo culture is also intimately connected to the forest (as is the culture of many other ethnic groups in the country).\nIn the south of Gabon are the Bahoumbou, who say that any crops planted will take on the attributes of their environment. Because of this, cassava, a popular tuber in West Africa, can only be planted when the moon is waxing or waning. This allows it to grow its healthy crescent shape, mimicking that of the moon.\nAlthough these beliefs provide only a glimpse into the many perspectives in the region (those living in Libreville, for example, are often Christian and don\u0026rsquo;t share in the beliefs listed above), they provide an interesting context for future outreach work in the area. Communities that are often excluded from outreach work can be reached through thoughtful consideration of these cultural threads.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"243802d548af9b38c4243b7eff48746f","permalink":"https://alexandergagliano.github.io/project/ethnoastronomy_gabon/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ethnoastronomy_gabon/","section":"project","summary":"I traveled to Gabon in 2016 and interviewed local anthropologists to learn about traditional astronomy beliefs in the region.","tags":["ethnoastronomy","outreach"],"title":"Ethnoastronomy in Gabon","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The large-scale distribution of globular clusters in the central region of the Coma cluster of galaxies is derived through the analysis of Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys data.

Red globular clusters, which agglomerate around the center of the three main subgroups, reach higher surface densities than blue ones.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"c47c5ab29a004fed5d32a6f586d47d11","permalink":"https://alexandergagliano.github.io/project/coma_gcs/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/coma_gcs/","section":"project","summary":"Using the largest map created to date of globular clusters in Coma to derive the global structure of the population.","tags":["statistics","astrophysics"],"title":"Globular Clusters in Coma","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The National Science Foundation is interested in finding metrics for rapidly evaluating the \u0026lsquo;innovative potential\u0026rsquo; of Open Source Software (OSS) without using survey data.

In a team of three, I developed a model for autonomous vehicle behavior for the international Mathematical Contest in Modeling. Our primary objectives for an autonomous vehicle were inspired by Boid\u0026rsquo;s principles of animal movement in a flock:\n Cohesion: An object moves toward the center of mass of similar neighbors. Separation: An object moves away from other flocks in order to prevent collision. Alignment: An object adjusts its orientation according to the orientation of the flock.  For this project, we modeled a section of road with two distinct actors - an autonomous vehicle, which we defined as a car that always executed an \u0026ldquo;optimal\u0026rdquo; driving decision; and human-operated vehicles, which executed optimal driving behaviors only stochastically. We then compare throughputs (the rate at which cars pass through a section of road) for different fractions of autonomous cars.\nOur models find that every section of road has its highest throughput at either 0% or 20% autonomous vehicles. At first, this may seem paradoxical. It is important to recognize, however, that autonomous vehicles in our model were created under the condition that none broke the speed limit of 60 mph. On the other hand, the speeds of human-operated vehicles were sampled from a gaussian centered at 60 mph. This means that any cars moving greater than 60 mph will be slowed down by an automated car moving in front of them. The greater the number of bots that \u0026ldquo;flock\u0026rdquo; together on the road (following Boid\u0026rsquo;s cohesion principle), the greater the likelihood that a car moving faster than the speed limit will be slowed and the lower the throughput. It is likely that this \u0026ldquo;flocking\u0026rdquo; of automated vehicles would decrease overall collisions, and this should be investigated in future studies.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"67977ee60f7a51471c6fb0412df790b6","permalink":"https://alexandergagliano.github.io/project/traffic_washington/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/traffic_washington/","section":"project","summary":"Would increasing the number of driverless cars in Washington State improve traffic flows?","tags":["modeling"],"title":"The Impact of Autonomous Vehicles on Washington State Traffic Flows","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451628000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451628000,"objectID":"7fbb5b127a5a9c81f96c5db13ad94342","permalink":"https://alexandergagliano.github.io/talk/cosmicperspectives/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/talk/cosmicperspectives/","section":"talk","summary":"Our current age of globalization has made it possible for international collaborations to thrive, and nowhere is this more evident than in astronomy. Growing networks such as the VLBA and the AVN have led to the construction of science centers in traditionally underserved communities, and low levels of light pollution in these areas provide favorable conditions for optical telescopes as well. For these reasons, astronomy provides an opportunity for economic development around the world. South Africa is a perfect example of this, as will be explored in more depth in this talk. Almost paradoxically, astronomy can be used to preserve regional culture as much as it can be used to promote global connectivity. As the oldest scientific discipline, nearly all societies are rooted in a rich history of astronomical heritage. Astronomical heritage within Gabon, United States, and China will be discussed as case studies. If we are to use astronomy to relate the past to the future, it is crucial that we make it accessible for every member of a society. We conclude by exploring efforts to bring the stars to the visually impaired, including a sonification-based astronomy exhibit called Sounds of the Spectrum that will be featured at the Story Of Space.","tags":null,"title":"Cosmic Perspectives in a Globalized Society","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451628000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451628000,"objectID":"ae55da263f94eea7523a80f2a31a7730","permalink":"https://alexandergagliano.github.io/talk/tedx/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/talk/tedx/","section":"talk","summary":"If art inspires us to help others see, then, as Plato said, “Astronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world to another.” Alex Gagliano wants to compel us to appreciate the stars and their connection to us in his talk 'Looking out to Look in.' Alex is an undergraduate from Virginia Tech studying Computational Modeling \u0026 Data Analytics, with a minor in International Studies. He is fascinated with the intersection between astronomy and the arts, as well as how astronomy education and research differs around the world. Alex worked as a researcher at the Cerro-Tololo Observatory in Chile and an Astronomy Ambassador with the American Astronomical Society. Most recently, he interned at the International Astronomical Union’s Office of Astronomy for Development in South Africa aiding in astroinformatics outreach. Alex hopes to enter graduate school next year, studying gravitational waves and communicating the beauty of the cosmos to others.","tags":null,"title":"Looking Out to Look In","type":"talk"}]
