The statistically significant variables in this model are:\nCircumstance, Weapon Used, State, Victim\u0026rsquo;s Sex, Victim\u0026rsquo;s Ethnicity, Victim\u0026rsquo;s Age, Number of Victims, and Date of Murder\nThese are unsettling findings, but they should be understood in the context of the model. The fact that these are correlated to the rate of solved/unsolved cases does not mean they cause it. It is possible that a particular ethnicity is more likely to become the victim of a certain type of crime (as is true with hate crimes), which may be easier or harder to solve than other murders.\nUsing a time-series of murders between 2002 and 2015, I find significant seasonal dependences on the crime rate. Significantly more murders than average are committed in summer ($p \u0026lt; 0.0003$), and significantly fewer are committed in the winter ($p \u0026lt; 0.002$). This linear time-series model had an Adjusted $R^2 = 0.69$.\nNext, I used a generalized linear model (unregularized) to predict the odds of the murderer not knowing the victim. At $75$% accuracy, and all other factors being equal, my results suggest:\nThe use of poison or drugs in a murder decreases the log-odds of the murderer being a stranger by $2.12$\nThe use of a gun increases the log-odds of the murderer being a stranger by $0.70$\nAn increase of 1 year in age of the victim decreases the log-odds of the murderer being a stranger by $0.005$.\nAn increase of every year in the year the crime was committed decreases the log-odds of the murderer being a stranger by $0.026$. This is particularly suspicious, and may indicate one of two things. Either the proportion of murders between strangers has been steadily decreasing since 1975, or the way that they\u0026rsquo;re being reported has changed.\nWe can use this same model to predict the probability of the stranger being a murderer for particular cases. A few of the findings from this procedure are as followed:\nIf a 25 year old male is shot and killed in 2000, and it goes unsolved, the model predicts that the probability is $30$% higher that the murderer was a stranger than if the victim were female. If a 50 year old woman is drugged/poisoned in 2000, and the case is solved, there\u0026rsquo;s a $99$% chance a family member did it. If a 25 year old woman is killed in 2000, and she was shot, the probability is $10$x higher that it was a stranger than if she was poisoned.\nI will continue this work to predict the killer\u0026rsquo;s relationship to the victim in particular cases.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"320e50a1f0dc00a9f597880b1dfb4380","permalink":"https://alexandergagliano.github.io/project/serial_killer/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/serial_killer/","section":"project","summary":"By aggressively using the Freedom of Information Act, SHNS reporter Tom Hargrove constructed a database of over 525,000 homicides from the past 30 years.

As a result, the culture across the country is beautifully diverse.\nOne of the prominent traditional religions in Gabon is called Bwiti. It is practiced by many different ethnic groups, but its largest congregation is the Fang people to the north. During a ceremony I was able to witness, Fang initiates were adorned with images of the sun, the moon, and the stars. The chieftain also wore a shirt with these images (see top picture). These objects represent the invisible world of spirits, and the knowledge gained from initiation.\nThe Tsogo people in central Gabon use astronomy predominantly in names. It is said that Tsogo people who lead a moral life will become a star after death, so children are named after objects in the sky, such as Ngonde, the moon and Mononga, the star, to give them good luck in life. In such close proximity to the Congolese rainforest, Tsogo culture is also intimately connected to the forest (as is the culture of many other ethnic groups in the country).\nIn the south of Gabon are the Bahoumbou, who say that any crops planted will take on the attributes of their environment. Because of this, cassava, a popular tuber in West Africa, can only be planted when the moon is waxing or waning.

It is therefore crucial to identify abilities and behaviors shared by all types of autonomous vehicles, which will reduce travel times and danger to the users. With the potential for communication between other autonomous vehicles, these cars will be able to mimic travel patterns of different species of animal, such as a school of fish. The behaviors that allow animals to travel efficiently in groups, which can also be developed in autonomous vehicles, are defined by Boid\u0026rsquo;s model of animal flocking:\n Cohesion: An object moves toward the center of mass of similar neighbors. Separation: An object moves away from other flocks in order to prevent collision. Alignment: An object adjusts its orientation according to the orientation of the flock.  Our model solution implements methods that mimic these 3 vital behaviors.1 Our models find that, with section 10 as an exception, every section of road has its highest throughput at either 0% or 20% autonomous vehicles. At first, this may seem paradoxical. It is important to recognize, however, that autonomous vehicles were created under the condition that none could attain a speed higher than the speed limit of 60 mph. On the other hand, the speeds of human-operated vehicles can range from 40 mph to 80mph, with only a mean of 60 mph. This means that any cars moving greater than 60 mph will be slowed down by a bot moving in front of them. The greater the number of bots on the road, the greater the likelihood that a car moving faster than the speed limit will be slowed down, decreasing the throughput.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"b9f2041cd38bed78d2b680f46575f195","permalink":"https://alexandergagliano.github.io/project/traffic_washington/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/traffic_washington/","section":"project","summary":"This report investigates the effect of increasing driverless cars on a closed segment of highway with a sophisticated simulation that includes various speeds, lane changes, levels of traffic, and other realistic characteristics of roadway flow.","tags":["machine-learning","datascience"],"title":"The Impact of Autonomous Vehicles on Washington State Traffic Flows","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451624400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451624400,"objectID":"7fbb5b127a5a9c81f96c5db13ad94342","permalink":"https://alexandergagliano.github.io/talk/cosmicperspectives/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/cosmicperspectives/","section":"talk","summary":"Our current age of globalization has made it possible for international collaborations to thrive, and nowhere is this more evident than in astronomy.

For these reasons, astronomy provides an opportunity for economic development around the world. South Africa is a perfect example of this, as will be explored in more depth in this talk. Almost paradoxically, astronomy can be used to preserve regional culture as much as it can be used to promote global connectivity.

Astronomical heritage within Gabon, United States, and China will be discussed as case studies.
